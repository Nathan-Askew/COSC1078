								<h2 class="major">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
								<p>My interest in IT started when I was quite young as I first got into PC gaming on an old laptop, this led to me gradually saving up to buy the parts of a computer for myself. As I did not have much to spend, I built the computer myself to save money, and learned a thing or two along the way. Since then my interest was largely focused on IT hardware and putting things together and making them fire up for the first time. However as I have used computers more and more I have gradually begun to enjoy work with IT software more and more, this lead me to take up Information Technology in high school so that I could learn more for at home, this came in very handy for setting up our home internet and LAN. When I got to VCE I picked up VCE IT and a cert 3 in information, digital media, and technology at the Gordon. This proved great as I learned more and more about working with computers in a number of fields such as networking, hardware, software, security, some coding, and more.</p>
