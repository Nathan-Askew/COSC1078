								<h2 class="major">Overview:</h2>
								<p>My Project Idea is to develop a simple application or website that can be used by anyone to find charity works, conservation efforts or other charity / crowd funded projects across Australia. Each of these charities will only be displayed on the site if they have been identified as a honest and impactful charity through prior investigation. This way people can open the site, browse across a country map, and look at different charity works currently going on. People can then select one of these charities and read all about what they do and then donate.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Motivation:</h2>
								<p>This application will be useful as there are many people out there, myself included, that want to help by donating money but want to know where their money is going and how it is going to help. There is also currently a lot of mistrust with charities across Australia. This is partially due to a number of large charities taking in millions of dollars of donations for the 2019-2020 summer bushfires relief and large portions of these donations were not being sent out to those that needed immediate help. This is one of the reasons that I believe that a donations site where people can see where their money is really going is hugely important.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Description:</h2>
								<p>This application would be made relatively simply, it would function with a map of Australia that would display a number of pinpoint markers. Each of these markers would correspond to a different charity or project. Customer would then be able to select one of these map markers and be taken to a page that will give an overview of the charity or project such as who it is run by, what they do, who are they helping? And what would the donations they receive be used for.</p>
								<p>Through this customer will be able to browse a number of charities and projects across the county and pick something that is in their local area or simply something that they are passionate about or have an interest in. Alternatively, if a donator is unsure about what to donate too there could also be a randomize function that can be used to pick a random charity for those that simply want to donate but do not know what they want to donate too. As well as this, there could be a “Our top picks” section with some charities or projects that we find particularly beneficial or in dire need of funding. This could be updated on a regular basis so that a wide range of charities get this extra help that many of them are in dire need of.</p>
								<p>This site would most likely be run as a Not-For-Profit organization as it would be rather unethical to make money of charity. Some revenue will need to be generated however, to cover the costs of running the site or application and make sure that it can be kept up to date and new charities can be added as new ones come up. This revenue could be generated through a number of different ways, but I have narrowed it down to two that would most likely have the best results without impeding on donators.</P>
								<p>One would be through advertisements being posted on the sites so that we can get cash flow from advertisers posting their ads on our site. These advertisements would most likely be more heavily focused on wholesome advertising as it would be rather distasteful to have certain ads for products or games on a site where we are asking for donations.</p>
								<p>The other option would be to have an option for donators to give a small percentage of their donation to our site to cover our running costs as a sort of tip. To make this tipping system more smoothly integrated it would most likely be best to implement it as a slider on the donation page that controls how much of the donators money goes to charity and if they would like to give some to our site then that would be their choice. This system would most likely function quite similarly to the online store called Humble Bundle (as shown below).</p>

								<p>By using both of these methods combined the site should be able to cover itself financially but whether it would make any more than this would be uncertain. If it did generate more income than was needed to cover the running costs, then this money would be used to put back into the site. This could be done through updating the site, expanding to a wider range of platforms, advertising our site more widely to get more donators or by simply putting any excess funding we receive into one of our many charities, perhaps the one that has received the least donations that year.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Tools and Technologies:</h2>
								<p>For software I would most likely build the site myself through either GitHub or simply through Visual Studio as this is the software that I am familiar with. I would most likely use an open-source template and use this as a base on which to build the site. Alternatively if I wish to customize the site more I could start from scratch, however this will take a lot more time and work. Once I had developed the site and I was happy with how it looked, functioned and ran I would most likely outsource to a website hosting service to run the website publicly. This way I will not need to acquire any hardware myself.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Skills required:</h2>
								<p>For this project I will need skills in HTML, CSS and possibly JavaScript. With all three of these coding skills I will be able to develop a site that functions and looks as I would want it. These skills are quite easy to acquire as I already have a basic level of knowledge on these coding languages and there are a number of places that can provide further training in them. As for software, I already have all of the tools that I need.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Outcome:</h2>
								<p>If this project is successful there will be a site that anyone can use to find honest impactful charities and will be able donate too them with complete peace of mind that their donations are going to be used by the rite people and for the reasons.</p>
